<b>BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.</b>
</p>

<pre>

<b>To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:</b>

     Our gain in net worth during 1991 was $2.1 billion, or=20
39.6%. Over the last 27 years (that is, since present management=20
took over) our per-share book value has grown from $19 to $6,437,=20
or at a rate of 23.7% compounded annually.

     The size of our equity capital - which now totals $7.4=20
billion - makes it certain that we cannot maintain our past rate=20
of gain or, for that matter, come close to doing so. As Berkshire=20
grows, the universe of opportunities that can significantly=20
influence the company's performance constantly shrinks. When we=20
were working with capital of $20 million, an idea or business=20
producing $1 million of profit added five percentage points to=20
our return for the year. Now we need a $370 million idea (i.e.,=20
one contributing over $550 million of pre-tax profit) to achieve=20
the same result. And there are many more ways to make $1 million=20
than to make $370 million.

     Charlie Munger, Berkshire's Vice Chairman, and I have set a=20
goal of attaining a 15% average annual increase in Berkshire's=20
intrinsic value. If our growth in <i>book</i> value is to keep up with a=20
15% pace, we must earn $22 billion during the next decade. Wish=20
us luck - we'll need it.

     Our outsized gain in book value in 1991 resulted from a=20
phenomenon not apt to be repeated:  a dramatic rise in the price-
earnings ratios of Coca-Cola and Gillette. These two stocks=20
accounted for nearly $1.6 billion of our $2.1 billion growth in=20
net worth last year. When we loaded up on Coke three years ago,=20
Berkshire's net worth was $3.4 billion; now our Coke stock alone=20
is worth more than that.

     Coca-Cola and Gillette are two of the best companies in the=20
world and we expect their earnings to grow at hefty rates in the=20
years ahead. Over time, also, the value of our holdings in these=20
stocks should grow in rough proportion. Last year, however, the=20
valuations of these two companies rose far faster than their=20
earnings. In effect, we got a double-dip benefit, delivered=20
partly by the excellent earnings growth and even more so by the=20
market's reappraisal of these stocks. We believe this reappraisal=20
was warranted. But it can't recur annually:  We'll have to settle=20
for a single dip in the future.

<b>A Second Job</b>

     In 1989 when I - a happy consumer of five cans of Cherry=20
Coke daily - announced our purchase of $1 billion worth of Coca-
Cola stock, I described the move as a rather extreme example of=20
putting our money where my mouth was. On August 18 of last year,=20
when I was elected Interim Chairman of Salomon Inc, it was a=20
different story: I put my mouth where our money was.

     You've all read of the events that led to my appointment. My=20
decision to take the job carried with it an implicit but=20
important message: Berkshire's operating managers are so=20
outstanding that I knew I could materially reduce the time I was=20
spending at the company and yet remain confident that its=20
economic progress would not skip a beat. The Blumkins, the=20
Friedman family, Mike Goldberg, the Heldmans, Chuck Huggins, Stan=20
Lipsey, Ralph Schey and Frank Rooney (CEO of H.H. Brown, our=20
latest acquisition, which I will describe later) are all masters=20
of their operations and need no help from me. My job is merely to=20
treat them right and to allocate the capital they generate.=20
Neither function is impeded by my work at Salomon.

     The role that Charlie and I play in the success of our=20
operating units can be illustrated by a story about  George Mira,=20
the one-time quarterback of the University of Miami, and his=20
coach, Andy Gustafson. Playing Florida and near its goal line,=20
Mira dropped back to pass. He spotted an open receiver but found=20
his right shoulder in the unshakable grasp of a Florida=20
linebacker. The right-handed Mira thereupon switched the ball to=20
his other hand and threw the only left-handed pass of his life -=20
for a touchdown. As the crowd erupted, Gustafson calmly turned to=20
a reporter and declared: "Now that's what I call coaching."

     Given the managerial stars we have at our operating units,=20
Berkshire's performance is not affected if Charlie or I slip away=20
from time to time. You should note, however, the "interim" in my=20
Salomon title. Berkshire is my first love and one that will never=20
fade: At the Harvard Business School last year, a student asked=20
me when I planned to retire and I replied, "About five to ten=20
years after I die."

<b>Sources of Reported Earnings</b>

     The table below shows the major sources of Berkshire's=20
reported earnings. In this presentation, amortization of Goodwill=20
and other major purchase-price accounting adjustments are not=20
charged against the specific businesses to which they apply, but=20
are instead aggregated and shown separately. This procedure lets=20
you view the earnings of our businesses as they would have been=20
reported had we not purchased them. I've explained in past=20
reports why this form of presentation seems to us to be more=20
useful to investors and managers than one utilizing generally=20
accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which require purchase-
price adjustments to be made on a business-by-business basis. The=20
total net earnings we show in the table are, of course, identical=20
to the GAAP total in our audited financial statements.

     A large amount of additional information about these=20
businesses is given on pages 33-47, where you also will find=20
our segment earnings reported on a GAAP basis. However, we will=20
not in this letter discuss each of our non-insurance operations,=20
as we have in the past. Our businesses have grown in number - and=20
will continue to grow - so it now makes sense to rotate coverage,=20
discussing one or two in detail each year.

<b>"Look-Through" Earnings</b>

     We've previously discussed look-through earnings, which=20
consist of: (1) the operating earnings reported in the previous=20
section, plus; (2) the retained operating earnings of major=20
investees that, under GAAP accounting, are not reflected in our=20
profits, less; (3) an allowance for the tax that would be paid by=20
Berkshire if these retained earnings of investees had instead been=20
distributed to us.

     I've told you that over time look-through earnings must=20
increase at about 15% annually if our intrinsic business value is=20
to grow at that rate. Indeed, since present management took over in=20
1965, our look-through earnings have grown at almost the identical=20
23% rate of gain recorded for book value.

     Last year, however, our look-through earnings did not grow at=20
all but rather declined by 14%. To an extent, the decline was=20
precipitated by two forces that I discussed in last year's report=20
and that I warned you would have a negative effect on look-through=20
earnings.

     First, I told you that our media earnings - both direct and=20
look-through - were "sure to decline" and they in fact did. The=20
second force came into play on April 1, when the call of our=20
Gillette preferred stock required us to convert it into common. The=20
after-tax earnings in 1990 from our preferred had been about $45=20
million, an amount somewhat higher than the combination in 1991 of=20
three months of dividends on our preferred plus nine months of=20
look-through earnings on the common.

     Two other outcomes that I did not foresee also hurt look-
through earnings in 1991. First, we had a break-even result from=20
our interest in Wells Fargo (dividends we received from the company=20
were offset by negative retained earnings). Last year I said that=20
such a result at Wells was "a low-level possibility - not a=20
likelihood." Second, we recorded significantly lower - though still=20
excellent - insurance profits.

     The following table shows you how we calculate look-through=20
earnings, although I warn you that the figures are necessarily very=20
rough. (The dividends paid to us by these investees have been=20
included in the operating earnings itemized on page 6, mostly=20
under "Insurance Group: Net Investment Income.")

     We also believe that investors can benefit by focusing on=20
their own look-through earnings. To calculate these, they should=20
determine the underlying earnings attributable to the shares they=20
hold in their portfolio and total these. The goal of each investor=20
should be to create a portfolio (in effect, a "company") that will=20
deliver him or her the highest possible look-through earnings a=20
decade or so from now. =20

     An approach of this kind will force the investor to think=20
about long-term business prospects rather than short-term stock=20
market prospects, a perspective likely to improve results. It's=20
true, of course, that, in the long run, the scoreboard for=20
investment decisions is market price. But prices will be determined=20
by future earnings. In investing, just as in baseball, to put runs=20
on the scoreboard one must watch the playing field, not the=20
scoreboard.

<b>A Change in Media Economics and Some Valuation Math</b>

     In last year's report, I stated my opinion that the decline in=20
the profitability of media companies reflected secular as well as=20
cyclical factors. The events of 1991 have fortified that case: The=20
economic strength of once-mighty media enterprises continues to=20
erode as retailing patterns change and advertising and=20
entertainment choices proliferate. In the business world,=20
unfortunately, the rear-view mirror is always clearer than the=20
windshield: A few years back no one linked to the media business -=20
neither lenders, owners nor financial analysts - saw the economic=20
deterioration that was in store for the industry. (But give me a=20
few years and I'll probably convince myself that I did.)

     The fact is that newspaper, television, and magazine=20
properties have begun to resemble <i>businesses</i> more than <i>franchises=
</i>=20
in their economic behavior. Let's take a quick look at the=20
characteristics separating these two classes of enterprise, keeping=20
in mind, however, that many operations fall in some middle ground=20
and can best be described as weak franchises or strong businesses.

     An economic franchise arises from a product or service that:=20
(1) is needed or desired; (2) is thought by its customers to have=20
no close substitute and; (3) is not subject to price regulation.=20
The existence of all three conditions will be demonstrated by a=20
company's ability to regularly price its product or service=20
aggressively and thereby to earn high rates of return on capital.=20
Moreover, franchises can tolerate mis-management. Inept managers=20
may diminish a franchise's profitability, but they cannot inflict=20
mortal damage.

     In contrast, "a business" earns exceptional profits only if it=20
is the low-cost operator or if supply of its product or service is=20
tight. Tightness in supply usually does not last long. With=20
superior management, a company may maintain its status as a low-
cost operator for a much longer time, but even then unceasingly=20
faces the possibility of competitive attack. And a business, unlike=20
a franchise, can be killed by poor management.

     Until recently, media properties possessed the three=20
characteristics of a franchise and consequently could both price=20
aggressively and be managed loosely. Now, however, consumers=20
looking for information and entertainment (their primary interest=20
being the latter) enjoy greatly broadened choices as to where to=20
find them. Unfortunately, demand can't expand in response to this=20
new supply: 500 million American eyeballs and a 24-hour day are all=20
that's available. The result is that competition has intensified,=20
markets have fragmented, and the media industry has lost some -=20
though far from all - of its franchise strength.

                    * * * * * * * * * * * *

     The industry's weakened franchise has an impact on its value=20
that goes far beyond the immediate effect on earnings. For an=20
understanding of this phenomenon, let's look at some much over-
simplified, but relevant, math.

     A few years ago the conventional wisdom held that a newspaper,=20
television or magazine property would forever increase its earnings=20
at 6% or so annually and would do so <i>without the employment of=20
additional capital</i>, for the reason that depreciation charges would=20
roughly match capital expenditures and working capital requirements=20
would be minor. Therefore, reported earnings (before amortization=20
of intangibles) were also freely-distributable earnings, which=20
meant that ownership of a media property could be construed as akin=20
to owning a perpetual annuity set to grow at 6% a year. Say, next,=20
that a discount rate of 10% was used to determine the present value=20
of that earnings stream. One could then calculate that it was=20
appropriate to pay a whopping $25 million for a property with=20
current after-tax earnings of $1 million. (This after-tax multiplier=20
of 25 translates to a multiplier on pre-tax earnings of about 16.)

     Now change the assumption and posit that the $1 million=20
represents "normal earning power" and that earnings will bob around=20
this figure cyclically. A "bob-around" pattern is indeed the lot of=20
most businesses, whose income stream grows only if their owners are=20
willing to commit more capital (usually in the form of retained=20
earnings). Under our revised assumption, $1 million of earnings,=20
discounted by the same 10%, translates to a $10 million valuation.=20
Thus a seemingly modest shift in assumptions reduces the property's=20
valuation to 10 times after-tax earnings (or about 6 1/2 times=20
pre-tax earnings).

     Dollars are dollars whether they are derived from the=20
operation of media properties or of steel mills. What in the past=20
caused buyers to value a dollar of earnings from media far higher=20
than a dollar from steel was that the earnings of a media property=20
were expected to constantly grow (without the business requiring=20
much additional capital), whereas steel earnings clearly fell in=20
the bob-around category. Now, however, expectations for media have=20
moved toward the bob-around model. And, as our simplified example=20
illustrates, valuations must change dramatically when expectations=20
are revised.

     We have a significant investment in media - both through our=20
direct ownership of Buffalo News and our shareholdings in The=20
Washington Post Company and Capital Cities/ABC - and the intrinsic=20
value of this investment has declined materially because of the=20
secular transformation that the industry is experiencing. (Cyclical=20
factors have also hurt our current look-through earnings, but these=20
factors do not reduce intrinsic value.) However, as our Business=20
Principles on page 2-3 note, one of the rules by which we run=20
Berkshire is that we do not sell businesses - or investee holdings=20
that we have classified as permanent - simply because we see ways=20
to use the money more advantageously elsewhere. (We did sell=20
certain other media holdings sometime back, but these were=20
relatively small.)

     The intrinsic value losses that we have suffered have been=20
moderated because the Buffalo News, under Stan Lipsey's leadership,=20
has done far better than most newspapers and because both Cap=20
Cities and Washington Post are exceptionally well-managed. In=20
particular, these companies stayed on the sidelines during the late=20
1980's period in which purchasers of media properties regularly=20
paid irrational prices. Also, the debt of both Cap Cities and=20
Washington Post is small and roughly offset by cash that they hold.=20
As a result, the shrinkage in the value of their assets has not=20
been accentuated by the effects of leverage. Among publicly-owned=20
media companies, our two investees are about the only ones=20
essentially free of debt. Most of the other companies, through a=20
combination of the aggressive acquisition policies they pursued and=20
shrinking earnings, find themselves with debt equal to five or more=20
times their current net income.

     The strong balance sheets and strong managements of Cap Cities=20
and Washington Post leave us more comfortable with these=20
investments than we would be with holdings in any other media=20
companies. Moreover, most media properties continue to have far=20
better economic characteristics than those possessed by the average=20
American business. But gone are the days of bullet-proof franchises=20
and cornucopian economics.

<b>Twenty Years in a Candy Store</b>

     We've just passed a milestone: Twenty years ago, on January 3,=20
1972, Blue Chip Stamps (then an affiliate of Berkshire and later=20
merged into it) bought control of See's Candy Shops, a West Coast=20
manufacturer and retailer of boxed-chocolates. The nominal price=20
that the sellers were asking - calculated on the 100% ownership we=20
ultimately attained - was $40 million. But the company had $10=20
million of excess cash, and therefore the true offering price was=20
$30 million. Charlie and I, not yet fully appreciative of the value=20
of an economic franchise, looked at the company's mere $7 million=20
of tangible net worth and said $25 million was as high as we would=20
go (and we meant it). Fortunately, the sellers accepted our offer.

     The sales of trading stamps by Blue Chip thereafter declined=20
from $102.5 million in 1972 to $1.2 million in 1991. But See's=20
candy sales in the same period increased from $29 million to $196=20
million. Moreover, profits at See's grew even faster than sales,=20
from $4.2 million pre-tax in 1972 to $42.4 million last year.

     For an increase in profits to be evaluated properly, it must=20
be compared with the incremental capital investment required to=20
produce it. On this score, See's has been astounding: The company=20
now operates comfortably with only $25 million of net worth, which=20
means that our beginning base of $7 million has had to be=20
supplemented by only $18 million of reinvested earnings. Meanwhile,=20
See's remaining pre-tax profits of $410 million were distributed to=20
Blue Chip/Berkshire during the 20 years for these companies to=20
deploy (after payment of taxes) in whatever way made most sense.

     In our See's purchase, Charlie and I had one important=20
insight: We saw that the business had untapped pricing power.=20
Otherwise, we were lucky twice over. First, the transaction was not=20
derailed by our dumb insistence on a $25 million price. Second, we=20
found Chuck Huggins, then See's executive vice-president, whom we=20
instantly put in charge. Both our business and personal experiences=20
with Chuck have been outstanding. One example: When the purchase=20
was made, we shook hands with Chuck on a compensation arrangement -=20
conceived in about five minutes and never reduced to a written=20
contract - that remains unchanged to this day.

     In 1991, See's sales volume, measured in dollars, matched that=20
of 1990. In pounds, however, volume was down 4%. All of that=20
slippage took place in the last two months of the year, a period=20
that normally produces more than 80% of annual profits. Despite the=20
weakness in sales, profits last year grew 7%, and our pre-tax=20
profit margin was a record 21.6%.

     Almost 80% of See's sales come from California and our=20
business clearly was hurt by the recession, which hit the state=20
with particular force late in the year. Another negative, however,=20
was the mid-year initiation in California of a sales tax of 7%-8=AB%=20
(depending on the county involved) on "snack food" that was deemed=20
applicable to our candy.

     Shareholders who are students of epistemological shadings will=20
enjoy California's classifications of "snack" and "non-snack"=20
foods:

     Taxable "Snack" Foods         Non-Taxable "Non-Snack" Foods
     ---------------------         -----------------------------
     Ritz Crackers                 Soda Crackers
     Popped Popcorn                Unpopped Popcorn
     Granola Bars                  Granola Cereal
     Slice of Pie (Wrapped)        Whole Pie
     Milky Way Candy Bar           Milky Way Ice Cream Bar

     What - you are sure to ask - is the tax status of a <i>melted</i>=20
Milky Way ice cream bar? In that androgynous form, does it more=20
resemble an ice cream bar or a candy bar that has been left in the=20
sun?  It's no wonder that Brad Sherman, Chairman of California's=20
State Board of Equalization, who opposed the snack food bill but=20
must now administer it, has said: "I came to this job as a=20
specialist in tax law. Now I find my constituents should have=20
elected Julia Child."

     Charlie and I have many reasons to be thankful for our=20
association with Chuck and See's. The obvious ones are that we've=20
earned exceptional returns and had a good time in the process.=20
Equally important, ownership of See's has taught us much about the=20
evaluation of franchises. We've made significant money in certain=20
common stocks because of the lessons we learned at See's.

<b>H. H. Brown</b>

     We made a sizable acquisition in 1991 - the H. H. Brown=20
Company - and behind this business is an interesting history. In=20
1927 a 29-year-old businessman named Ray Heffernan purchased the=20
company, then located in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, for=20
$10,000 and began a 62-year career of running it. (He also found=20
time for other pursuits: At age 90 he was still joining new golf=20
clubs.) By Mr. Heffernan's retirement in early 1990 H. H. Brown had=20
three plants in the United States and one in Canada; employed close=20
to 2,000 people; and earned about $25 million annually before=20
taxes.

     Along the way, Frances Heffernan, one of Ray's daughters,=20
married Frank Rooney, who was sternly advised by Mr. Heffernan=20
before the wedding that he had better forget any ideas he might=20
have about working for his father-in-law. That was one of Mr.=20
Heffernan's few mistakes: Frank went on to become CEO of Melville=20
Shoe (now Melville Corp.). During his 23 years as boss, from 1964=20
through 1986, Melville's earnings averaged more than 20% on equity=20
and its stock (adjusted for splits) rose from $16 to $960. And a=20
few years after Frank retired, Mr. Heffernan, who had fallen ill,=20
asked him to run Brown.

     After Mr. Heffernan died late in 1990, his family decided to=20
sell the company - and here we got lucky. I had known Frank for a=20
few years but not well enough for him to think of Berkshire as a=20
possible buyer. He instead gave the assignment of selling Brown to=20
a major investment banker, which failed also to think of us. But=20
last spring Frank was playing golf in Florida with John Loomis, a=20
long-time friend of mine as well as a Berkshire shareholder, who is=20
always on the alert for something that might fit us. Hearing about=20
the impending sale of Brown, John told Frank that the company=20
should be right up Berkshire's alley, and Frank promptly gave me a=20
call. I thought right away that we would make a deal and before=20
long it was done.

     Much of my enthusiasm for this purchase came from Frank's=20
willingness to continue as CEO. Like most of our managers, he has=20
no financial need to work but does so because he loves the game and=20
likes to excel. Managers of this stripe cannot be "hired" in the=20
normal sense of the word. What we must do is provide a concert hall=20
in which business artists of this class will wish to perform.

     Brown (which, by the way, has no connection to Brown Shoe of=20
St. Louis) is the leading North American manufacturer of work shoes=20
and boots, and it has a history of earning unusually fine margins=20
on sales and assets. Shoes are a tough business - of the billion=20
pairs purchased in the United States each year, about 85% are=20
imported  - and most manufacturers in the industry do poorly. The=20
wide range of styles and sizes that producers offer causes=20
inventories to be heavy; substantial capital is also tied up in=20
receivables. In this kind of environment, only outstanding managers=20
like Frank and the group developed by Mr. Heffernan can prosper.

     A distinguishing characteristic of H. H. Brown is one of the=20
most unusual compensation systems I've encountered - but one that=20
warms my heart: A number of key managers are paid an annual salary=20
of $7,800, to which is added a designated percentage of the profits=20
of the company after these are reduced by a charge for capital=20
employed. These managers therefore truly stand in the shoes of=20
owners. In contrast, most managers talk the talk but don't walk the=20
walk, choosing instead to employ compensation systems that are long=20
on carrots but short on sticks (and that almost invariably treat=20
equity capital as if it were cost-free).  The arrangement at Brown,=20
in any case, has served both the company and its managers=20
exceptionally well, which should be no surprise:  Managers eager to=20
bet heavily on their abilities usually have plenty of ability to=20
bet on.

                    * * * * * * * * * * * *

     It's discouraging to note that though we have on four=20
occasions made major purchases of companies whose sellers were=20
represented by prominent investment banks, we were in only one of=20
these instances contacted by the investment bank. In the other=20
three cases, I myself or a friend initiated the transaction at some=20
point after the investment bank had solicited its own list of=20
prospects. We would love to see an intermediary earn its fee by=20
thinking of us - and therefore repeat here what we're looking for:

     (1) Large purchases (at least $10 million of after-tax=20
         earnings),
     (2) Demonstrated consistent earning power (future projections=20
         are of little interest to us, nor are "turnaround"=20
         situations),
     (3) Businesses earning good returns on equity while employing=20
         little or no debt,
     (4) Management in place (we can't supply it),
     (5) Simple businesses (if there's lots of technology, we=20
         won't understand it),
     (6) An offering price (we don't want to waste our time or=20
         that of the seller by talking, even preliminarily,=20
         about a transaction when price is unknown).

     We will not engage in unfriendly takeovers. We can promise=20
complete confidentiality and a very fast answer - customarily=20
within five minutes - as to whether we're interested. (With Brown,=20
we didn't even need to take five.) We prefer to buy for cash, but=20
will consider issuing stock when we receive as much in intrinsic=20
business value as we give.

     Our favorite form of purchase is one fitting the pattern=20
through which we acquired Nebraska Furniture Mart, Fechheimer's and=20
Borsheim's. In cases like these, the company's owner-managers wish=20
to generate significant amounts of cash, sometimes for themselves,=20
but often for their families or inactive shareholders.  At the same=20
time, these managers wish to remain significant owners who continue=20
to run their companies just as they have in the past. We think we=20
offer a particularly good fit for owners with such objectives and=20
we invite potential sellers to check us out by contacting people=20
with whom we have done business in the past.

     Charlie and I frequently get approached about acquisitions=20
that don't come close to meeting our tests:  We've found that if=20
you advertise an interest in buying collies, a lot of people will=20
call hoping to sell you their cocker spaniels. A line from a=20
country song expresses our feeling about new ventures, turnarounds,=20
or auction-like sales: "When the phone don't ring, you'll know it's=20
me."

     Besides being interested in the purchase of businesses as=20
described above, we are also interested in the negotiated purchase=20
of large, but not controlling, blocks of stock comparable to those=20
we hold in Capital Cities, Salomon, Gillette, USAir, Champion, and=20
American Express. We are not interested, however, in receiving=20
suggestions about purchases we might make in the general stock=20
market.

     The combined ratio represents total insurance costs (losses=20
incurred plus expenses) compared to revenue from premiums: A=20
ratio below 100 indicates an underwriting profit, and one above=20
100 indicates a loss. The higher the ratio, the worse the year.=20
When the investment income that an insurer earns from holding=20
policyholders' funds ("the float") is taken into account, a=20
combined ratio in the 107 - 111 range typically produces an=20
overall break-even result, exclusive of earnings on the funds=20
provided by shareholders.

     For the reasons laid out in previous reports, we expect the=20
industry's incurred losses to grow at close to 10% annually, even=20
in periods when general inflation runs considerably lower. (Over=20
the last 25 years, incurred losses have in reality grown at a=20
still faster rate, 11%.) If premium growth meanwhile materially=20
lags that 10% rate, underwriting losses will mount.

     However, the industry's tendency to under-reserve when=20
business turns bad may obscure the picture for a time - and that=20
could well describe the situation last year. Though premiums did=20
not come close to growing 10%, the combined ratio failed to=20
deteriorate as I had expected but instead slightly improved. =20
Loss-reserve data for the industry indicate that there is reason=20
to be skeptical of that outcome, and it may turn out that 1991's=20
ratio should have been worse than was reported. In the long run,=20
of course, trouble awaits managements that paper over operating=20
problems with accounting maneuvers. Eventually, managements of=20
this kind achieve the same result as the seriously-ill patient=20
who tells his doctor: "I can't afford the operation, but would=20
you accept a small payment to touch up the x-rays?"

     Berkshire's insurance business has changed in ways that make=20
combined ratios, our own or the  industry's, largely irrelevant=20
to our performance. What counts with us is the "cost of funds=20
developed from insurance," or in the vernacular, "the cost of=20
float."

     Float - which we generate in exceptional amounts - is the=20
total of loss reserves, loss adjustment expense reserves and=20
unearned premium reserves minus agents balances, prepaid=20
acquisition costs and deferred charges applicable to assumed=20
reinsurance. And the cost of float is measured by our=20
underwriting loss.

     As you can see, our cost of funds in 1991 was well below the=20
U. S. Government's cost on newly-issued long-term bonds. We have in=20
fact beat the government's rate in 20 of the 25 years we have been=20
in the insurance business, often by a wide margin. We have over=20
that time also substantially increased the amount of funds we hold,=20
which counts as a favorable development but only because the cost=20
of funds has been satisfactory. Our float should continue to grow;=20
the challenge will be to garner these funds at a reasonable cost.

     Berkshire continues to be a very large writer - perhaps the=20
largest in the world - of "super-cat" insurance, which is coverage=20
that other insurance companies buy to protect themselves against=20
major catastrophic losses.  Profits in this business are enormously=20
volatile. As I mentioned last year, $100 million in super-cat=20
premiums, which is roughly our annual expectation, could deliver us=20
anything from a $100 million profit (in a year with no big=20
catastrophe) to a $200 million loss (in a year in which a couple of=20
major hurricanes and/or earthquakes come along).

     We price this business expecting to pay out, over the long=20
term, about 90% of the premiums we receive.  In any given year,=20
however, we are likely to appear either enormously profitable or=20
enormously unprofitable.  That is true in part because GAAP=20
accounting does not allow us to set up reserves in the catastrophe-
free years for losses that are certain to be experienced in other=20
years. In effect, a one-year accounting cycle is ill-suited to the=20
nature of this business - and that is a reality you should be aware=20
of when you assess our annual results.

     Last year there appears to have been, by our definition, one=20
super-cat, but it will trigger payments from only about 25% of our=20
policies. Therefore, we currently estimate the 1991 underwriting=20
profit from our catastrophe business to have been about $11=20
million. (You may be surprised to learn the identity of the biggest=20
catastrophe in 1991:  It was neither the Oakland fire nor Hurricane=20
Bob, but rather a September typhoon in Japan that caused the=20
industry an insured loss now estimated at about $4-$5 billion. At=20
the higher figure, the loss from the typhoon would surpass that=20
from Hurricane Hugo, the previous record-holder.)

     Insurers will always need huge amounts of reinsurance=20
protection for marine and aviation disasters as well as for natural=20
catastrophes. In the 1980's much of this reinsurance was supplied=20
by "innocents" - that is, by insurers that did not understand the=20
risks of the business - but they have now been financially burned=20
beyond recognition. (Berkshire itself was an innocent all too often=20
when I was personally running the insurance operation.)  Insurers,=20
though, like investors, eventually repeat their mistakes. At some=20
point - probably after a few catastrophe-scarce years - innocents=20
will reappear and prices for super-cat policies will plunge to=20
silly levels.

     As long as apparently-adequate rates prevail, however, we will=20
be a major participant in super-cat coverages.  In marketing this=20
product, we enjoy a significant competitive advantage because of=20
our premier financial strength.  Thinking insurers know that when=20
"the big one" comes, many reinsurers who found it easy to write=20
policies will find it difficult to write checks. (Some reinsurers=20
can say what Jackie Mason does: "I'm fixed for life - as long as I=20
don't buy anything.") Berkshire's ability to fulfill all its=20
commitments under conditions of even extreme adversity is=20
unquestioned.

     Overall, insurance offers Berkshire its greatest=20
opportunities. Mike Goldberg has accomplished wonders with this=20
operation since he took charge and it has become a very valuable=20
asset, albeit one that can't be appraised with any precision.

<b>Marketable Common Stocks</b>

     On the next page we list our common stock holdings having a=20
value of over $100 million. A small portion of these investments=20

     As usual the list reflects our Rip Van Winkle approach to=20
investing. Guinness is a new position. But we held the other seven=20
stocks a year ago (making allowance for the conversion of our=20
Gillette position from preferred to common) and in six of those we=20
hold an unchanged number of shares. The exception is Federal Home=20
Loan Mortgage ("Freddie Mac"), in which our shareholdings increased=20
slightly. Our stay-put behavior reflects our view that the stock=20
market serves as a relocation center at which money is moved from=20
the active to the patient. (With tongue only partly in check, I=20
suggest that recent events indicate that the much-maligned "idle=20
rich" have received a bad rap: They have maintained or increased=20
their wealth while many of the "energetic rich" - aggressive real=20
estate operators, corporate acquirers, oil drillers, etc. - have=20
seen their fortunes disappear.)

     Our Guinness holding represents Berkshire's first significant=20
investment in a company domiciled outside the United States.=20
Guinness, however, earns its money in much the same fashion as=20
Coca-Cola and Gillette, U.S.-based companies that garner most of=20
their profits from international operations. Indeed, in the sense=20
of where they earn their profits - continent-by-continent - Coca-
Cola and Guinness display strong similarities. (But you'll never=20
get their drinks confused - and your Chairman remains unmovably in=20
the Cherry Coke camp.)

     We continually search for large businesses with=20
understandable, enduring and mouth-watering economics that are run=20
by able and shareholder-oriented managements. This focus doesn't=20
guarantee results: We both have to buy at a sensible price and get=20
business performance from our companies that validates our=20
assessment. But this investment approach - searching for the=20
superstars - offers us our only chance for real success. Charlie=20
and I are simply not smart enough, considering the large sums we=20
work with, to get great results by adroitly buying and selling=20
portions of far-from-great businesses. Nor do we think many others=20
can achieve long-term investment success by flitting from flower to=20
flower. Indeed, we believe that according the name "investors" to=20
institutions that trade actively is like calling someone who=20
repeatedly engages in one-night stands a romantic.

     If my universe of business possibilities was limited, say, to=20
private companies in Omaha, I would, first, try to assess the long-
term economic characteristics of each business; second, assess the=20
quality of the people in charge of running it; and, third, try to=20
buy into a few of the best operations at a sensible price. I=20
certainly would not wish to own an equal part of every business in=20
town. Why, then, should Berkshire take a different tack when=20
dealing with the larger universe of public companies? And since=20
finding great businesses and outstanding managers is so difficult,=20
why should we discard proven products? (I was tempted to say "the=20
real thing.") Our motto is: "If at first you do succeed, quit=20
trying."

     John Maynard Keynes, whose brilliance as a practicing investor=20
matched his brilliance in thought, wrote a letter to a business=20
associate, F. C. Scott, on August 15, 1934 that says it all: "As=20
time goes on, I get more and more convinced that the right method=20
in investment is to put fairly large sums into enterprises which=20
one thinks one knows something about and in the management of which=20
one thoroughly believes.  It is a mistake to think that one limits=20
one's risk by spreading too much between enterprises about which=20
one knows little and has no reason for special confidence. . . .=20
One's knowledge and experience are definitely limited and there are=20
seldom more than two or three enterprises at any given time in=20
which I personally feel myself entitled to put <i>full</i> confidence."

<b>Mistake Du Jour</b>

     In the 1989 annual report I wrote about "Mistakes of the First=20
25 Years" and promised you an update in 2015. My experiences in the=20
first few years of this second "semester" indicate that my backlog=20
of matters to be discussed will become unmanageable if I stick to=20
my original plan. Therefore, I will occasionally unburden myself in=20
these pages in the hope that public confession may deter further=20
bumblings. (Post-mortems prove useful for hospitals and football=20
teams; why not for businesses and investors?)

     Typically, our most egregious mistakes fall in the omission,=20
rather than the commission, category. That may spare Charlie and me=20
some embarrassment, since you don't see these errors; but their=20
invisibility does not reduce their cost. In this mea culpa, I am=20
not talking about missing out on some company that depends upon an=20
esoteric invention (such as Xerox), high-technology (Apple), or=20
even brilliant merchandising (Wal-Mart). We will never develop the=20
competence to spot such businesses early. Instead I refer to=20
business situations that Charlie and I can understand and that seem=20
clearly attractive - but in which we nevertheless end up sucking=20
our thumbs rather than buying.

     Every writer knows it helps to use striking examples, but I=20
wish the one I now present wasn't quite so dramatic: In early 1988,=20
we decided to buy 30 million shares (adjusted for a subsequent=20
split) of Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which=20
would have been a $350-$400 million investment. We had owned the=20
stock some years earlier and understood the company's business.=20
Furthermore, it was clear to us that David Maxwell, Fannie Mae's=20
CEO, had dealt superbly with some problems that he had inherited=20
and had established the company as a financial powerhouse - with=20
the best yet to come. I visited David in Washington and confirmed=20
that he would not be uncomfortable if we were to take a large=20
position.

     After we bought about 7 million shares, the price began to=20
climb. In frustration, I stopped buying (a mistake that,=20
thankfully, I did not repeat when Coca-Cola stock rose similarly=20
during our purchase program).  In an even sillier move, I=20
surrendered to my distaste for holding small positions and sold the=20
7 million shares we owned.

     I wish I could give you a halfway rational explanation for my=20
amateurish behavior vis-a-vis Fannie Mae.  But there isn't one.=20
What I <i>can</i> give you is an estimate as of yearend 1991 of the=20
approximate gain that Berkshire <i>didn't</i> make because of your=20
Chairman's mistake: about $1.4 billion.

<b>Fixed-Income Securities</b>

     We made several significant changes in our fixed-income=20
portfolio during 1991. As I noted earlier, our Gillette preferred=20
was called for redemption, which forced us to convert to common=20
stock; we eliminated our holdings of an RJR Nabisco issue that was=20
subject to an exchange offer and subsequent call; and we purchased=20
fixed-income securities of American Express and First Empire State=20
Corp., a Buffalo-based bank holding company. We also added to a=20
small position in ACF Industries that we had established in late=20
1990.  Our largest holdings at yearend were:

	(1) Fair value as determined by Charlie and me
	(2) Carrying value in our financial statements

     Our $40 million of First Empire State preferred carries a 9%=20
coupon, is non-callable until 1996 and is convertible at $78.91 per=20
share. Normally I would think a purchase of this size too small for=20
Berkshire, but I have enormous respect for Bob Wilmers, CEO of=20
First Empire, and like being his partner on any scale.

     Our American Express preferred is not a normal fixed-income=20
security. Rather it is a "Perc," which carries a fixed dividend of=20
8.85% on our $300 million cost. Absent one exception mentioned=20
later, our preferred must be converted three years after issuance,=20
into a maximum of 12,244,898 shares. If necessary, a downward=20
adjustment in the conversion ratio will be made in order to limit=20
to $414 million the total value of the common we receive. Though=20
there is thus a ceiling on the value of the common stock that we=20
will receive upon conversion, there is no floor. The terms of the=20
preferred, however, include a provision allowing us to extend the=20
conversion date by one year if the common stock is below $24.50 on=20
the third anniversary of our purchase.

     Overall, our fixed-income investments have treated us well,=20
both over the long term and recently. We have realized large=20
capital gains from these holdings, including about $152 million in=20
1991. Additionally, our after-tax yields have considerably exceeded=20
those earned by most fixed-income portfolios.

     Nevertheless, we have had some surprises, none greater than=20
the need for me to involve myself personally and intensely in the=20
Salomon situation. As I write this letter, I am also writing a=20
letter for inclusion in Salomon's annual report and I refer you to=20
that report for an update on the company. (Write to: Corporate=20
Secretary, Salomon Inc, Seven World Trade Center, New York, NY =20
10048) Despite the company's travails, Charlie and I believe our=20
Salomon preferred stock increased slightly in value during 1991. =20
Lower interest rates and a higher price for Salomon's common=20
produced this result.

     Last year I told you that our USAir investment "should work=20
out all right unless the industry is decimated during the next few=20
years." Unfortunately 1991 was a decimating period for the=20
industry, as Midway, Pan Am and America West all entered=20
bankruptcy. (Stretch the period to 14 months and you can add=20
Continental and TWA.)

     The low valuation that we have given USAir in our table=20
reflects the risk that the industry will remain unprofitable for=20
virtually all participants in it, a risk that is far from=20
negligible. The risk is heightened by the fact that the courts have=20
been encouraging bankrupt carriers to continue operating. These=20
carriers can temporarily charge fares that are below the industry's=20
costs because the bankrupts don't incur the capital costs faced by=20
their solvent brethren and because they can fund their losses - and=20
thereby stave off shutdown - by selling off assets. This burn-the-
furniture-to-provide-firewood approach to fare-setting by bankrupt=20
carriers contributes to the toppling of previously-marginal=20
carriers, creating a domino effect that is perfectly designed to=20
bring the industry to its knees.

     Seth Schofield, who became CEO of USAir in 1991, is making=20
major adjustments in the airline's operations in order to improve=20
its chances of being one of the few industry survivors. There is no=20
tougher job in corporate America than running an airline: Despite=20
the huge amounts of equity capital that have been injected into it,=20
the industry, in aggregate, has posted a net loss since its birth=20
after Kitty Hawk.  Airline managers need brains, guts, and=20
experience - and Seth possesses all three of these attributes.

<b>Miscellaneous</b>

     About 97.7% of all eligible shares participated in Berkshire's=20
1991 shareholder-designated contributions program. Contributions=20
made through the program were $6.8 million, and 2,630 charities=20
were recipients.

     We suggest that new shareholders read the description of our=20
shareholder-designated contributions program that appears on pages=20
48-49. To participate in future programs, you must make sure your=20
shares are registered in the name of the actual owner, not in the=20
nominee name of a broker, bank or depository.  Shares not so=20
registered on August 31, 1992 will be ineligible for the 1992=20
program.

     In addition to the shareholder-designated contributions that=20
Berkshire distributes, managers of our operating businesses make=20
contributions, including merchandise, averaging about $1.5 million=20
annually.  These contributions support local charities, such as The=20
United Way, and produce roughly commensurate benefits for our=20
businesses.

     However, neither our operating managers nor officers of the=20
parent company use Berkshire funds to make contributions to broad=20
national programs or charitable activities of special personal=20
interest to them, except to the extent they do so as shareholders.=20
If your employees, including your CEO, wish to give to their alma=20
maters or other institutions to which they feel a personal=20
attachment, we believe they should use their own money, not yours.

     The faithful will notice that, for the first time in some=20
years, Charlie's annual letter to Wesco shareholders is not=20
reprinted in this report. Since his letter is relatively barebones=20
this year, Charlie said he saw no point in including it in these=20
pages; my own recommendation, however, is that you get a copy of=20
the Wesco report. Simply write: Corporate Secretary, Wesco=20

     Malcolm G. Chace, Jr., now 88, has decided not to stand for=20
election as a director this year.  But the association of the Chace=20
family with Berkshire will not end: Malcolm III (Kim), Malcolm's=20
son, will be nominated to replace him.

     In 1931, Malcolm went to work for Berkshire Fine Spinning=20
Associates, which merged with Hathaway Manufacturing Co. in 1955 to=20
form our present company. Two years later, Malcolm became Berkshire=20
Hathaway's Chairman, a position he held as well in early 1965 when=20
he made it possible for Buffett Partnership, Ltd. to buy a key=20
block of Berkshire stock owned by some of his relatives.  This=20
purchase gave our partnership effective control of the company.=20
Malcolm's immediate family meanwhile kept its Berkshire stock and=20
for the last 27 years has had the second-largest holding in the=20
company, trailing only the Buffett family. Malcolm has been a joy=20
to work with and we are delighted that the long-running=20
relationship between the Chace family and Berkshire is continuing=20
to a new generation.

     The annual meeting this year will be held at the Orpheum=20
Theater in downtown Omaha at 9:30 a.m. on Monday, April 27, 1992.=20
Attendance last year grew to a record 1,550, but that still leaves=20
plenty of room at the Orpheum.

     We recommend that you get your hotel reservations early at one=20
of these hotels: (1) The Radisson-Redick Tower, a small (88 rooms)=20
but nice hotel across the street from the Orpheum; (2) the much=20
larger Red Lion Hotel, located about a five-minute walk from the=20
Orpheum; or (3) the Marriott, located in West Omaha about 100 yards=20
from Borsheim's and a twenty minute drive from downtown. We will=20
have buses at the Marriott that will leave at 8:30 and 8:45 for the=20
meeting and return after it ends.

     Charlie and I always enjoy the meeting, and we hope you can=20
make it. The quality of our shareholders is reflected in the=20
quality of the questions we get: We have never attended an annual=20
meeting anywhere that features such a consistently high level of=20
intelligent, owner-related questions.

     An attachment to our proxy material explains how you can=20
obtain the card you will need for admission to the meeting. With=20
the admission card, we will enclose information about parking=20
facilities located near the Orpheum. If you are driving, come a=20
little early.  Nearby lots fill up quickly and you may have to=20
walk a few blocks.

     As usual, we will have buses to take you to Nebraska Furniture=20
Mart and Borsheim's after the meeting and to take you from there to=20
downtown hotels or the airport later. I hope that you will allow=20
plenty of time to fully explore the attractions of both stores.=20
Those of you arriving early can visit the Furniture Mart any day of=20
the week; it is open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Saturdays and=20
from noon to 5:30 p.m. on Sundays. While there, stop at the See's=20
Candy Cart and find out for yourself why Americans ate 26 million=20
pounds of See's products last year.

     Borsheim's normally is closed on Sunday, but we will be open=20
for shareholders and their guests from noon to 6 p.m. on Sunday,=20
April 26. Borsheim's will also have a special party the previous=20
evening at which shareholders are welcome. (You must, however,=20
write Mrs. Gladys Kaiser at our office for an invitation.) On=20
display that evening will be a 150-year retrospective of the most=20
exceptional timepieces made by Patek Philippe, including watches=20
once owned by Queen Victoria, Pope Pius IX, Rudyard Kipling, Madame=20
Curie and Albert Einstein. The centerpiece of the exhibition will=20
be a $5 million watch whose design and manufacture required nine=20
years of labor by Patek Philippe craftsmen.  Along with the rest of=20
the collection, this watch will be on display at the store on=20
Sunday - unless Charlie has by then impulsively bought it.

     Nicholas Kenner nailed me - again - at last year's meeting,=20
pointing out that I had said in the 1990 annual report that he was=20
11 in May 1990, when actually he was 9. So, asked Nicholas rather=20
caustically: "If you can't get that straight, how do I know the=20
numbers in the back [the financials] are correct?" I'm still=20
searching for a snappy response. Nicholas will be at this year's=20
meeting - he spurned my offer of a trip to Disney World on that=20
day - so join us to watch a continuation of this lop-sided battle=20
of wits.
